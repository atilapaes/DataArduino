File1.TXT was created using the conversion to float as analog_read*(5.00/1023.00). The full scale of 5 V is not the most accurate one once the tension in the Pin 5 V varies. 
The data generated can be transformed by * (2*ref_vol_div/5) for a better precision..
Unsolved question: The ref_vol_div itself is using the transformation using the nominal 5V as ref. 

As the Nominal 5 V pin from Arduino varies a bit, using the conversion of ref as 5 V, and then locking all the other measures to the instantaneous measure of the reference voltage seems to be one of the most assertive measurement technique available for this hardware.



File2.TXT. the version two incorporates the instantaneous correction of the reference voltage.
